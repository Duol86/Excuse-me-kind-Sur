Stuff I use

to get these icons first download them and then open the shortcuts app and create a new shortcut. next add an action, then go to scripting the open app then tap 'choose'  and select your app, then click 'add to home screen' change the default name (or just have no name like I did) and then pick the photo and select the icon you want for it! done! you now have a nice icon on your home screen!
